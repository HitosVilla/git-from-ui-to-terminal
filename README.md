# Basic steps to learn Git using the terminal

In this repo you have a very simple project (a web project that displays a number via the console log), we will provide a guide to recreate it from scratch on a brand new repo.


We will use git terminal commands to setup and work with the repo.

# Creating the repo

You can choose whether to use HTTPS (your standard git login user) or SSH (a more secure approach to treat with your repos but need some additional configuration).
